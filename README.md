# craigslist_used_car_analysis
Objective: This project aims to predict the list prices of used cars on Craigslist, helping users determine if the prices presented are fair. It focuses on understanding the influence of various car attributes on list prices.

Data Source: The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, consists of 426,881 used car listings scraped from Craigslist between April 4th and May 4th, 2021. It includes attributes like year, make, model, condition, and price.

Tools and Technologies: The project utilizes Python for data analysis, with libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

Methodology: The project employs regression techniques, including linear regression and random forest models, across five different regions of the United States to predict car prices. It investigates the relationship between car attributes and list prices, particularly examining the impact of transmission type on car value.

Key Findings:

The analysis identifies key attributes influencing used car prices, with region-specific models providing insights into local market dynamics.
No statistical difference in list prices between manual and automatic transmission vehicles was found, challenging common perceptions.
Challenges: Handling missing data and ensuring model accuracy were significant challenges, alongside computational limitations encountered during model training.

Learnings: The project highlights the importance of data cleaning and preparation in predictive modeling. It also demonstrates the value of machine learning in deriving insights from complex datasets.

Future Work: Future directions include extending the analysis over longer periods, incorporating more variables, and comparing Craigslist data with other platforms to enhance model accuracy and applicability.
